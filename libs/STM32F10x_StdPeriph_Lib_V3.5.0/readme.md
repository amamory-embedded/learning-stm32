To open this CHM file you will need to install a new software such as, for example:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install xchm
```

There is a newer version ([3.6.1](https://github.com/dimtass/stdperiph)) of StdPeriph for STM32F1xx laying around the Internet. However,
since version [3.5.0](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-stm32054.html) is still the how in the STM website, I will use the official one.
